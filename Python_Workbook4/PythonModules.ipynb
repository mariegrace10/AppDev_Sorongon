There are a number of mathematical constants in the Python math module, such as math.pi, math.e, math.tau, math.inf, math.nan.\n","\n","B. math.exp is the function that takes a parameter (e, which is approximately equivalent to 2.71828) and returns e raised to the power of x. Stated differently, e^x is computed by math.exp(x).\n","The value of x raised to the power of y is returned by the math.pow function. It is comparable to Python's ** operator, but it always yields a floating-point output. As an illustration, math.pow(2, 3) yields 8.0.\n","\n","C. Base 10 logarithms (log10): The math.log10(x) function can be used to get the logarithm of a given number x.
